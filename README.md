# ForYouMyLove 💗

A romantic interactive webpage made as a digital love letter.  
Soft gradients, floating hearts, sweet transitions, personal notes, music, and memories — all wrapped in a gentle pink aesthetic.

This project is made with love, care, and a little bit of CSS magic.

Sometimes it can be *built*.
